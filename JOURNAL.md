- Added user_accounts migration (0011_create_user_accounts.sql)
- All CI checks passed: build, format, clippy, tests
- Committed and pushed changes to remote repository

## 2026-05-10 11:40

- **Phase 1 Complete**: Performance Infrastructure Optimization
- Increased database connection pool from 20 to 100 connections (configurable via DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS env var)
- Added basic connection pool metrics to /metrics endpoint (total connections, idle connections)
- Changes validated with cargo check and committed to repository

## 2026-05-10 11:43

- **Phase 2 Complete**: Async Runtime Optimization
- Implemented custom tokio runtime with adaptive worker threads (num_cpus - 1 for stability, minimum 1)
- Added TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS environment variable for configuration
- Enhanced metrics with runtime information (worker threads, CPU cores)

## 2026-05-10 16:21

- **Search API Enhancement**: Implemented 3 new features in actix_handlers.rs:
  - `?fields=` field filtering: parse_fields_param + filter_listing_fields to return only requested fields
  - `?include=` eager loading: returns _include meta object indicating available relations
  - Cursor pagination: DB-level via ORDER BY + WHERE listing_id > cursor (listings.rs)
- Cache key now includes fields and include params for proper cache segregation
- All features compile successfully

## 2026-05-10 16:21

- Added unit tests for search API helper functions in actix_handlers.rs:
  - parse_fields_param: tests for single/multiple/empty fields
  - parse_include_param: tests for single/multiple/lowercase normalization
  - filter_listing_fields: tests for filtering, empty fields, non-object handling
- Fixed http/mod.rs test visibility (was excluding actix_handlers in test mode)
- Fixed pre-existing broken import in api-contract tests
- All 70 tests pass (62 existing + 8 new)

## 2026-05-10 15:31

- **Expanded Unit Test Coverage**
- Added 16 tests for search service (normalize_search_terms, listing_index_text, score_listing, compare_search_items)
- Added 9 tests for listings repository (insert, get, search with filters/sorting/pagination)
- Fixed pre-existing compilation errors in db.rs and listings.rs (quantity type mismatch)
- All 62 server lib tests now pass
- Added num_cpus dependency for automatic CPU detection
- Supports low-resource deployments (2-thread VPS and up)
- Changes validated with cargo check and committed to repository

## 2026-05-10 11:50

- **Phase 3 Complete**: Enhanced Caching Implementation
- Increased listing cache from 10,000 to 100,000 entries with 10-minute TTL
- Increased search cache from 1,000 to 50,000 entries with 5-minute TTL
- Added cache entry count metrics to /metrics endpoint
- Implemented TTL-based cache eviction policies for automatic cleanup
- Changes validated with cargo check and committed to repository

## 2026-05-10 11:55

- **Phase 4 Complete**: Monitoring and Observability
- Added utilization percentages for database connections and caches
- Implemented memory usage estimation for cache monitoring
- Created comprehensive monitoring setup guide with Prometheus/Grafana instructions
- All metrics now available in Prometheus format at /metrics endpoint
- Performance infrastructure optimization project complete
- Expected performance improvement: 6.8k → 40k+ ops/s at 5000 concurrency

## 2026-05-10 15:31

- **Performance Fix**: Search endpoint was extremely slow (~100 ops/s) due to missing SQL LIMIT clause
- Root cause: fetch_rows() was fetching ALL matching rows (potentially 100K) and sorting in memory
- Added LIMIT clause (uses request limit, defaults to 50, max 200) to prevent excessive row fetching
- Results:
  - Cold search: 2.46s → 17ms (145x faster)
  - Warm search: ~100 ops/s → ~25,000 ops/s (250x faster)
  - 500 concurrency now hits 100% success rate (was ~77%)
- Also fixed double JSON serialization in search handler (serialize once, use for both cache and response)

## 2026-05-10 15:42

- **Performance Optimization**: Full benchmark sweep shows massive improvements
- Fixed double JSON serialization in get_listing handler (same issue as search)
- Search performance (warm cache):
  - 100 concurrency: 52,641 ops/s (was ~22K)
  - 200 concurrency: 57,976 ops/s (was ~30K)
  - 500 concurrency: 40,351 ops/s (was ~23K)
- All benchmark phases achieve 100% success rate
- get_listing works at ~25K ops/s when tested standalone
- Note: get_listing at high concurrency (500) shows degradation - appears to be benchmark client limitation, not server

## 2026-05-10 15:42

- **API Optimization**: Added response compression (gzip) - built into actix-web middleware
- **Search Cache Key**: Improved to include listing_type, category, sort_by for better cache hits
- Benchmark results with optimizations:
  - Search 100: 51,700 ops/s
  - Search 200: 57,977 ops/s
  - Search 500: 30,297 ops/s

## 2026-05-10 18:10

- Tightened `check.ps1` journal guard to compare the committed journal as a line-prefix, so rewritten history fails and append-only updates pass.

## 2026-05-11 06:30

  - Old Actix routes (`/v1/product/`, `/v1/service/`, `/v1/property/`) now redirect to unified endpoint
  - Added deprecation handlers returning 301 with Deprecation/Sunset/Link headers
  - Sunset date: Sat, 01 Jun 2026
  - Removed unused `status_transitions` module reference

## 2026-05-11 11:00

- **Phase 3.3 complete**: Created `docs/TESTING.md` with test organization, naming conventions, data builder patterns, coverage philosophy, and adding-tests checklist
- **Phase 3.4 complete**: Filled critical coverage gaps:
  - `services/contact_reveals.rs`: added 2 error path tests (approve nonexistent → NotFound, get missing → None)
  - `repositories/seller_accounts.rs`: added 10 in-memory operation tests (get_by_owner_id, update_trust_level, update_quota_override, increment_listings_created — each with happy path + not-found edge case)

  - 152 lib tests pass; clippy clean; TODO items marked complete
## 2026-05-11 14:52

- Reworked `NEGOTIATION-DESIGN.md` into a brainstorm doc so it stays aligned with the current contract while leaving room for a later negotiation spec.

## 2026-05-11 15:01

- Locked the negotiation brainstorm toward richer offer history, negotiation-led offer tracking, and explicit accept/reject actions for the next spec direction.

## 2026-05-11 15:05

- Promoted the negotiation brainstorm into an active spec under `docs/specs/_active/NEGOTIATION-OFFER-HISTORY.md` with richer offer history and explicit finalization actions.

## 2026-05-11 15:37

- Moved the negotiation work into a full active spec bundle under `docs/specs/_active/0003-negotiation-offer-history/` with baseline, plan, decisions, validation, and metadata files.

## 2026-05-11 15:41

- Clarified the negotiation spec baseline so contract surface and runtime implementation are separated cleanly.

## 2026-05-11 18:09

- Locked `0003-negotiation-offer-history` to an append-only negotiation history schema with explicit `accept` and `reject` actions.

## 2026-05-11 18:35

- Reviewed and normalized active spec strategy governance under `docs/specs/_active/0001-unified-listings-endpoint`, `0002-listing-id-cleanup`, and `0003-negotiation-offer-history`.
- Aligned status/implementer metadata between frontmatter/spec YAML and README body text so workflow state is consistent and auditable.
- Fixed broken 0001 contract-doc references from `docs/whitepaper/10-api-contract.md` to `docs/01-whitepaper/10-api-contract.md`.
- Replaced placeholder governance docs with concrete quality rules, validation checklists, implementation notes, and internal API outlines to enforce shared-service logic, contract parity, authz/idempotency guardrails, and safer rollout checks.

## 2026-05-11 18:50

- Executed an `_active` spec lint pass for legacy `docs/whitepaper/...` references, placeholder governance text, and README metadata/body consistency.
- Replaced remaining placeholder `ci-commands.md` and `decisions.md` files for specs `0001`, `0002`, and `0003` with concrete checks and decision logs.
- Added an automated `active spec governance guard` to `check.ps1` so CI now blocks legacy doc paths, placeholder governance text, and status/implementer drift in `_active` specs.
- Re-ran guard-only checks (`./check.ps1 -SkipBuild -SkipFormat -SkipClippy -SkipTests`) and confirmed pass.
- Recorded OpenAPI parity outcomes in active spec decisions docs to keep contract drift visible before backend implementation PRs.

## 2026-05-11 19:05

- Normalized `0001-unified-listings-endpoint` wording from mixed `/api/...` and `/v1/...` forms to consistent `/v1/...` paths with explicit `{listing_id}` naming across README, spec metadata, plan, baseline, and internal API outline.
- Added machine-readable parity artifacts (`parity-report.md`) for active specs `0001`, `0002`, and `0003` to document contract alignment status in a repeatable JSON snapshot format.
- Ran full `./check.ps1` (no skip flags); all guards and Rust checks passed (journal guard, active spec guard, cargo check, fmt, clippy, tests).

## 2026-05-11 19:20

- Started implementation for active negotiation spec (`0003`) across contract, repository, app, HTTP runtime, and MCP wrapper layers.
- Added negotiation offer history persistence (`offer_history` JSONB migration `0013_add_negotiation_offer_history.sql`) and new submit/accept/reject flows.
- Fixed concurrent open-negotiation behavior to enforce single-winner conflict semantics in both in-memory and Postgres negotiation repositories.
- Updated race-condition test to keep both concurrent requests authorized so it validates repository conflict behavior.
- Validated implementation with `cargo test --lib` (152 passed).

## 2026-05-11 19:45

- Hardened `check.ps1` journal guard to avoid CRLF warning crashes and keep append-only validation reliable in local PowerShell runs.
- Fixed `api-contract` test initialization for `NegotiationResponse` by adding `offer_history` so all targets compile under clippy/test.
- Added a targeted `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` on `MarketplaceApp::new` after introducing the negotiation repository dependency, preserving constructor compatibility across runtimes/tests.
- Re-ran full `./check.ps1` (no skip flags): journal guard, active spec governance, cargo check, fmt, clippy, and tests all pass.

## 2026-05-11 20:05

- Updated `docs/specs/openapi.yaml` to include negotiation `accept`/`reject` operations, new accept/reject request schemas, and `offer_history` schema fields so API docs match implemented backend routes.
- Added PostgreSQL negotiation integration coverage in `backend/server/tests/postgres_flows.rs` for submit-offer + accept flow and reject flow, including persisted status/final-offer/history assertions.
- Extended test schema setup to apply migration `0013_add_negotiation_offer_history.sql`, ensuring integration tests run against the current negotiation table shape.
- Locked the single-negotiation enforcement decision in `0003` docs (DB uniqueness via deterministic `neg_{listing_id}` + PK conflict) with option tradeoffs for future reopen semantics.
- Refreshed `0003` parity report and README/plan text so active-spec documentation reflects current contract/runtime behavior and no longer marks accept/reject/history as pending.

## 2026-05-11 20:43

- Ran full `./check.ps1` (no skip flags).
- Result: PASS for journal guard, active spec guard, cargo check, cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy -D warnings, and cargo test --lib.
- Why: validated current workspace is stable before continuing implementation.

## 2026-05-11 21:11

- Confirmed specs in sequence: `0003` then `0001` then `0002`.
- Updated `0003` and `0001` metadata/body status to `completed`; `0003` implementer set to `opencode` and validation checklist marked complete.

  - `0003-negotiation-offer-history`
  - `0001-unified-listings-endpoint`
  - `0002-listing-id-cleanup`
- Ran full `./check.ps1` after the move; all checks passed.

## 2026-05-11 21:15

- Created dedicated backend implementation commit after successful full `./check.ps1` run.
- Included negotiation offer-history + finalization implementation set across `api-contract`, app/runtime/handlers, repository persistence, MCP wiring, checker hardening, and migration `0013_add_negotiation_offer_history.sql`.
- Why: keep spec-lifecycle move and backend implementation separated for cleaner audit and rollback boundaries.
- Updated docs/specs/openapi.yaml to include negotiation ccept/eject operations, new accept/reject request schemas, and offer_history schema fields so API docs match implemented backend routes.
- Added PostgreSQL negotiation integration coverage in ackend/server/tests/postgres_flows.rs for submit-offer + accept flow and reject flow, including persisted status/final-offer/history assertions.
- Extended test schema setup to apply migration 013_add_negotiation_offer_history.sql, ensuring integration tests run against the current negotiation table shape.
- Locked the single-negotiation enforcement decision in 003 docs (DB uniqueness via deterministic 
eg_{listing_id} + PK conflict) with option tradeoffs for future reopen semantics.
- Refreshed 0003 parity report and README/plan text so active-spec documentation reflects current contract/runtime behavior and no longer marks accept/reject/history as pending.

## 2026-05-11 20:43

- Ran full ./check.ps1 (no skip flags).
- Result: PASS for journal guard, active spec guard, cargo check, cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy -D warnings, and cargo test --lib.

## 2026-05-11 21:21

- Performed governance cleanup after spec archival commits.
- Recovered legacy _active artifacts and archived them under _done instead of leaving destructive deletions:
  - performance-infrastructure-optimization/
  - TESTING-IMPROVEMENT-PROPOSAL.md
- Updated performance infrastructure archive README status to completed and implementer to opencode for metadata consistency.
- Moved test-planning docs out of repo root into docs/testing/ to keep root compact:
